# az-mm_genetic_algorithm
Delivery and routing minimization project with the use of Assignment problem and TSP Genetic Algorithm. 

The proposed solution presented in this code includes the framwork of a TSP Genetic Algorithm created by Ramez Noshy, rameziophobia, and enhanced by Arpa Zarokian and Maureen McAndrew for the application of our project.
